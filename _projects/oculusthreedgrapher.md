title: Oculus 3D Grapher
description: This project is my Senior Research Project at TJ. We are working on using javascript to render 3D Graphs to the Oculus Rift and then manipulating the graphs using the Leap Motion Sensor. This will allow the user to physically interact with the graph to make it easier to visualize 3D Graphs. Our goal is to help students to visualize graphs.
