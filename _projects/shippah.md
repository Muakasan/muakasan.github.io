title: Shippah
description: Shippah was a project which strived to improve a previously created project. The original project was done using a SQL database and a server we switched this to a website hosted using github pages and FireBase to imitate a backend. We also provided functionality to upload images. The idea of Shippah was to allow friends to casually "ship" together relationships as a joke. The gh-pages branch uses FireBase and the master branch uses Flask and SQLALchemy.
