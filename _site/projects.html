            <h2>CoMAPorate </h2>
                <p>CoMAPorate was a project designed for HackTJ 2015. The primary focus of the app was not to compete with an app like Google Maps, but instead allow users to edit a smaller map to more detail. The idea of this app was to allow users to create maps by uploading images of a map which could be easily taken with a phone camera and then uploaded to a database. After the map was added, other users would be allowed to join this map and edit collaboratively on the map by adding waypoints. These waypoints would have tags whose names and values would be chosen by the user allowing almost limitless extendability. For example, a group of students could edit a map of the school and mark out the different rooms in the school and tag the rooms based on teacher name or subject.</p>

            <h2>Oculus 3D Grapher </h2>
                <p>This project is my Senior Research Project at TJ. We are working on using javascript to render 3D Graphs to the Oculus Rift and then manipulating the graphs using the Leap Motion Sensor. This will allow the user to physically interact with the graph to make it easier to visualize 3D Graphs. Our goal is to help students to visualize graphs.</p>

            <h2>Shippah </h2>
                <p>Shippah was a project which strived to improve a previously created project. The original project was done using a SQL database and a server we switched this to a website hosted using github pages and FireBase to imitate a backend. We also provided functionality to upload images. The idea of Shippah was to allow friends to casually "ship" together relationships as a joke. The gh-pages branch uses FireBase and the master branch uses Flask and SQLALchemy.</p>
